      <h3>Smashers can punch at same velocity as a gunshot from a .22 caliber rifle.</h3>
        <p>Smasher mantis shrimp have two raptorial appendages (called ‘dactyl clubs’) on the front of its body that it uses to punch its prey. These fists are spring loaded, able to accelerate from their body at <strong>over 50 mph, delivering a force of over 1,500 newtons</strong>, enough to smash through crabs and clam shells.
        That’s 2.5k times the force of the shrimps own weight, if a human could do that they’d be able to punch through steel.</p>
